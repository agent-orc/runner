/// block-buffer <c>process.stdout</c> when stdout is a pipe instead of a terminal:

/// side's 4–8 KB write buffer until process exit. From the runner's perspective the
/// agent looks "silent after init" and a watchdog kills it as hung. The fix is to
/// spawn the CLI behind a pseudo-terminal, which makes
/// <c>process.stdout.isTTY === true</c> and Node flushes per newline (which is
/// exactly what <c>--output-format stream-json</c> emits).
